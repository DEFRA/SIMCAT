# SIMCAT

The official repository of the Environment Agencyâ€™s SIMCAT (SIMulation of CATchments) software tool. 

## About the project

The Environment Agency uses the SIMCAT modelling tool for water quality planning and permitting purposes. SIMCAT is central to the Price Review work with Water Companies and is used for planning improvements to Water Industry assets to meet Environmental Quality Standards. SIMCAT is one of the main tools used for discharge permitting and water management in the UK.

The Environment Agency has made SIMCAT available as Open-Source software and is hosted in this repository. The repository contains the latest releases of the tool as standalone executables, the source code, documentation and guidance for contributing.

## Getting started

To download the latest version, go to [Releases](/executables/README.md)

To read the manual, go to [Documentation](/docs). This includes a presentation and personal note from SIMCAT's developer Tony Warn.

## Installation

SIMCAT is distributed as a standalone executable application. The recommended usage is to download the latest release and unzip the folder with all the dependencies in your hard drive. SIMCAT is most commonly used in combination with [SAGIS](https://sagis.ukwir.org/sagis/welcome) (Source Apportionment GIS).
