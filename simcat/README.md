# SIMCAT codebase

The SIMCAT codebase comprises of two projects:

1. The user interface (UI) for SIMCAT (not to be confused with SAGIS), written in Visual Basic and distributed in the form of a Visual Studio project.
2. The fortran files that compile into the main SIMCAT executable.

This folder contains:

1. Fortran files to compile SIMCAT versions:
    1. 14.8 (0000 Fortran 148)
    2. 15.7 (0000 Fortran 157)
    3. 15.8 (0000 Fortran 158)
    4. 16.1 (0000 Fortran 161)
2. The Visual Studio project to compile the UI (SIM160).
