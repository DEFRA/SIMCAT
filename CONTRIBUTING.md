# Contributing

If you have an idea you'd like to contribute please log an [issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues).

If you'd like to suggest a change or addition, fork the repository, create a branch, add your changes to it, then submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).

## Getting started

Create a branch with a brief but descriptive name e.g. `feature_description`.

Start committing your changes and **push** straight away rather than when finished. We don't want your work to get lost!

When you are ready for feedback create the pull request. Take the time to give it a meaningful title and detailed description as this will help those reviewing it understand what you've done.

> Pro tip! If you create the PR straight after your first commit, GitHub will automatically populate the title and description for the new PR from the commit message.

Also assign yourself to the PR so folks know who created it and consider adding a label to the PR. These can help potential reviewers quickly see the nature of the it.

## Getting feedback

Feedback will be provided within the PR. Decisions will be documented and reasons given.

We want to encourage all to contribute and suggest ways we can improve. Anyone providing feedback should be positive and professional with any comments made about your contribution, but let us know if you feel we failed.

## Approval

Those that review your contribution when happy with it will leave a comment indicating so. 

## Finishing up

When your contribution has been approved, you can go ahead and merge it using the GitHub UI for the pull request.

> **IMPORTANT** If you have multiple commits on your branch it will squash them, and ask you to confirm what the final single commit message should be. Rewrite the message so it reflects the final change you've made (feedback may have changed your original intent) and why.

With that done sit back, have a üçπ, and ponder your next contribution!
